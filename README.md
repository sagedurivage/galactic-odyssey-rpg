## User Interface Specification

### Navigation Diagram

An illustration of how users will navigate from one screen to another, depending on what input is entered. Each screen is represented by a rectangle with a title inside. Each action is represented by text along the path from one screen to another.

  #### Updates

  File saving functionality has been withdrawn to prioritize development of essential functionality--feature methods still included in class diagram as placeholders. The inventory screen is consolidated to the in-game menu alongside other character stats, as the only consumable items are currency and medicine.

## Class Diagram

  <summary>Class Diagram v1.0.0</summary>
  
  ####
  
  The Character class serves as the base for the Player and the Companion, which contains the attributes related to STATs (power, health, protection, item, etc.), the methods used for player actions (travel, attack, etc.), and is composed of Location to track where they are at any time. 
  A player can track EXP, select an enemy to attack, and makes use of the GameManager class to manage their game via save, delete, and load.
  Medicine, weapons, and armor classes are derived from the Item class, in which Item objects are stored in the Shop and Inventory.
  The Enemey class is composed of an item, which will be dropped at random upon defeat.
  The Location class is used to store information for each location consisting of name, tasks, and if it has been discovered.
  Each task pertains to a specific location and has their own condition of completion, which is checked by the complete() method.

  #### Updates
  
  Classes Task, Inventory, Item, Potion and Player were removed. An Entity class was added to interface for the Character, Enemy and Companion classes. The Character and Enemy classes are interfaces for the 3 character and enemy type classes, respectively. The GameManager classâ€™s association to the Character class was updated to a dependency on the Entity interface, and a dependency was also included on the added Print and Map classes. The Print class is also dependent on the Map class, which is a composition of the Location class. An enumeration LocationType class was added to the Location class. An Equipment class was added to interface for the Weapon and Armor classes.
  
  #### SOLID Design Principles
  
  `Single-Responsibility` - The Print class is only responsible for displaying pre-defined strings in the form of text files to the console, and nothing else. Otherwise, this functionality would have been implemented within the GameManager class, convoluting its purpose.

  `Open-Closed` - Instead of defining how the GameManager class interacts with each Character, Companion and Enemy class the compatibility is just defined for the Entity interface, which can be expanded to interface for additional entities if needed. This update also reduced some, potentially redundant, load on the GameManager class.

  `Interface Segregation` - Each entity of the Entity interface only inherit usable methods, and entity-specific functionality is defined separately. Once a user selects which character type to play as the program is not forced to implement more than just that type class. This segregation maintains cleaner, more organized code and optimizes program performance by eliminating redundant implementation.

<details>
  <summary>Testing Procedure</summary>

  1. Our approach was to implement unit tests for each class, using lcov and gcov to ensure complete code coverage and building test executables with make. We also are using Github Actions to support the Continuous Integration of our project.
  
  2. Each team member is responsible for the unit testing of the classes they're developing, respectively.
  
  3. We tested our program with unit tests for each class function.
